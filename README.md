# blue

The Blue Trail is an iconic long distance walking route in Hungary. Since its creation in 1938 the path has been modified regularly, so if you need the updated trail, you have to check the website. 

To plan my trips I created this scrapy project, so I'll have an up-to-date and merged table with all the stamping points and section information.
